# NaughtyAttributes
This is a fork of [NaughtyAttributes](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes) that I use to add my own extensions to it. Most of the work that has gone into this repo is not mine.

**WARNING**: This package is deprecated. I have created [Hairibar.NaughtyExtensions](https://github.com/hairibar/Hairibar.NaughtyExtensions) and moved my extensions there. This fork will not receive any more updates. Any packages using this fork should move to using the main NaughtyAttributes repo as and Hairibar.NaughtyExtensions instead.

NaughtyAttributes is an extension for the Unity Inspector. This fork also includes more generalised functionality for making custom editors.
